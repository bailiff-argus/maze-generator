# Maze Creator

This program creates a labyrinth using a depth first approach
and prints it into the terminal.
The usage is as follows:
```
python3 ./main.py --width [WIDTH] --height [HEIGHT]
```
The width and height are the *inner* sizes of the labyrinth,
meaning that specifying `--width 1 --height 1` will create a single empty
cell surrounded by a wall.
